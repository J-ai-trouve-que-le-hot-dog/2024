Welcome to the Spaceship course!

In 2020, most of us have learned how to operate a spaceship. In this course we'll play a small chess-like game featuring the spaceship! The game operates on an infinite 2D chess board, with the spaceship initially located on `(0,0)`. The spaceship has a velocity `vx` and `vy`, which are initially both set to `0`. In each turn the player can increase/decrease each of those numbers by at most one, and then the piece moves `vx` steps to the right and `vy` steps up.

Moves are represented with a single digit, inspired by the old numeric pad on a computer keyboard that we used to have in the old days on Earth. For example, `7` means decreasing `vx` and increasing `vy` by `1`, while `6` means increasing `vx` by `1` and keeping `vy` the same. A path can then be represented by a sequence of digits, e.g. the path `236659` visits, in this order, the following squares: `(0,0) (0,-1) (1,-3) (3,-5) (6,-7) (9,-9) (13,-10)`.

Now the challenge is the following: given a list of squares to be visited, find a sequence of moves that visits all those squares. Your solution may consist of at most `10,000,000` moves.

The following levels are available:
* [spaceship1] Best score: 5.
* [spaceship2] Best score: 424.
* [spaceship3] Best score: 116.
* [spaceship4] Best score: 16464.
* [spaceship5] Best score: 828.
* [spaceship6] Best score: 25834.
* [spaceship7] Best score: 502.
* [spaceship8] Best score: 458.
* [spaceship9] Best score: 19182.
* [spaceship10] Best score: 99750.
* [spaceship11] Best score: 1037710.
* [spaceship12]
* [spaceship13]
* [spaceship14]
* [spaceship15]
* [spaceship16]
* [spaceship17]
* [spaceship18]
* [spaceship19]
* [spaceship20]
* [spaceship21]
* [spaceship22]
* [spaceship23]
* [spaceship24]
* [spaceship25]

To submit a solution, send an ICFP expression that evaluates to:

```
solve spaceshipX moves
```

Your score is the number of moves, so a lower score is better.
